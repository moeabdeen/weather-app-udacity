# Weather Journal App ☔

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. This is done through:
    - establishing a locale node server.
    - collecting data from user.
    - using OpenWeatherMap api to collect weather data.
    - Added POST and GET routes to retrieve data from the server.
    - Created async functions to fetch weather data and store locally.
    - Update Ui dynamically.

## Files:
    - server.js file which contains serverside code.
    - app.js which contains clientside code.
    - index.html
    - style.css
    - package.json and package-lock.json
    - don't forget to install the dependencies needed to run the project (express, cors, body-parser)
    - and of course, the readme file

## This is what the finished product looks like
