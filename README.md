# Weather Journal App â˜”

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. This is done through:
    - establishing a locale node server.
    - collecting data from user.
    - using OpenWeatherMap api to collect weather data.
    - Added POST and GET routes to retrieve data from the server.
    - Created async functions to fetch weather data and store locally.
    - Update Ui dynamically.
